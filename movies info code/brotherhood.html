        Twin brothers, Wale and Akin are orphaned when their parents are killed on New Year's day on their way home 
        from crossover church service. After years of fighting to survive on the streets of Lagos, the brothers fall on 
        opposite sides of the law with Wale joining the police force and Akin joining a notorious gang of robbers. 
        The bonds of brotherhood are put to the ultimate test as Wale joins a Task force that hunts down Akin and his gang.
